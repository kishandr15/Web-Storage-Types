# Web Storage Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating the usage of web storage in a browser environment. It includes examples for both Session Storage and Local Storage.

## Introduction

Web storage is a web storage API that allows web applications to store data within the client's web browser. There are two main types of web storage: Session Storage and Local Storage.

- **Session Storage**: Data stored in session storage persists only for the duration of the page session. It is available until the browser or tab is closed.
- **Local Storage**: Data stored in local storage persists even after the browser is closed and reopened. It is available across browser sessions.

This repository provides examples for both types of web storage, demonstrating how to use them to store and retrieve data within a web application.

The Local Storage Example creates a simple counter that increases each time a button is clicked. The count is stored in the local storage of the browser and persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.
